================

The training event originally scheduled for 14-15 Jan at NOSC Eleanor, WV is postponed due to logistics issues.  If we don't have a resolution by 1 Dec, then the event will be cancelled and those with billets to this event will be rescheduled for an event at NOSC Tucson.

If you have any questions, contact LCDR Burke at bryan.t.burke@gmail.com.
